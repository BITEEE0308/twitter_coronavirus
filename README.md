# Coronavirus twitter analysis

## Overview

In this project, I scanned and processed all geotagged tweets sent in 2020 to monitor for the spread of the coronavirus on social media following the MapReduce procedure. Specifically, this project visualizes the number of tweets each country and language sent in 2020 using the Hashtag #coronavirus in both English and Korean version. 


## Results

Four graphs were created to show the 10 countries or languages which post the most tweets with #coronavirus and #코로나바이러스 hashtags (the second hashtag is "coronavirus" in Korean) in 2020. I included the 4 graphs below.
